# SeedSeeker: Forensic Analysis of Random Number Generators

Statistical application that inspects observed data samples to infer the internal
parameters of pseudo- and quasi-random number generators (RNGs), including the
application of “Untwisting the Mersenne Twister” principles.

## Features

- Specialized inference algorithms to extract seeds and internal states from
  sampled data.
- Statistical and cryptanalytic methods (e.g., frequency tests, autocorrelation
  checks) to detect common transformations in RNG outputs.
- Clear user interface (either CLI or a basic GUI) for configuring tests,
  processing data, and visualizing results.
- Systematic software engineering practices, including modular code organization,
  unit and integration testing, and performance evaluations.
